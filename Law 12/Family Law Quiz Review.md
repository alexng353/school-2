# Family Law Part 2
#### Prior Marriages
> It is illegal for a person to enter into a second marriage while still being married

This is known as **bigamy**, a form of **polygamy** and constitutes a *Criminal Offence* liable to up to five years in prison

If you have been previously married, you must present proof that the previous marriage had ended. In cases where people do marry a second time, while still married to their first spouse, ***the second marriage would be legally null and void***

#### Disappearance of a Spouse
In the event that a spouse disappears and cannot be found for a long period of time, an application can be made to the court for a "presumption of death" certificate.

If a presumed dead spouse is actually alive and returns after the surviving spouse has remarried, the second marriage would be declared void

#### Sexual Capacity
Traditionall, the ability to **consummate** the marriage was an essential requirement for marriage. If either party lacks sexual capacity, the marriage may be annulled. The inability to have sexual intercourse must result from a physical or psychological problem.

#### Changing Names
There is no legal obligation in Canada for women to adopt the surname of their spouse.

Options available
1. Retain maiden name
2. Adopt their spouse's suername
3. Hyphenate both names (Lee-Izawa)

When a child is born to a married couple, the child is usually given the husband's surname or the hyphenated name of both parents. *The child may receive the mother's surname if both parents consent*. In cases of dispute, the child receives both names in alphabetical order.

## Refining Marriage
In July of 2002, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that the definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman was an unjustifiable infringement of S.15 of the Charter.

## Termination of Marriage: Death, Annulment, Separation
### Separation
> An intermediate step between marriage and divorce. The spouses decide to live separately and apart from each other. Sometimes couples stop at this point and live the rest of their lives this way.

Usually, "separate and apart" implies that they live in separate locations and they do not intend to live together again

***A divorce becomes final 31 days after the judgement***

### Custody
The court looks at what is in the ***best interests of the child***
***Custody orders are never final***, meaning they can be revisited at any time by the court to ensure that any changing circumstances are addressed so that the best interests of the child are always considered

### Custody Tests
1. **Stability of Home Environment** - The courts seek to reduce stress through providing a steady and stable routine for the children. This often menas that if one spouse has traditionally taken care of the children (***The Primary Caregiver***), custody will be awarded to that spouse. Some factors include:
	1. Who attended the child's educational, cultural and religious development;
	2. Who took the child to medical appointments;
	3. Who prepared the child's meals;
	4. Who bought the child's clothing; and
	5. Who looked after the child after school
2. **Separation of Siblings** - Courts do not like to separate siblings. However, when they are separated, mothers usually get custody of girls and younger children, while fathers may get custody of boys or older children.
3. **Children's Preferences and Wishes** - The wishes of children aged 14 and older are taken very seriously. Generally, the older the child, the greater influence of their wishes on the courts decision
4. **Parental Conduct** - The court accounts for parental conduct *when it directly affects the child*. This conduct may include: drug or alcohol abuse, violence or rage, or anything that may put the child at harm.
5. **Religion** - Courts believe that both parents should have input and refrain from ridiculing the other parent's religion. The best interests of the child is foremost in the minds of the court
# Family Law Part 4
## Child Support
> In 1997, the federal government introduced new guidelines outlining the appropriate level of child support in cases of divorce.

The level of support is based on the following:
1. Which province or territory the non-custodial parent lives in
2. The non-custodial parent's income; and
3. The number of children

However, these guidelines do not cover everything. Courts may also make orders for additional support to cover the following:
1. Childcare expenses due to work, school or illness
2. Medical and health related expenses over $100 not covered by insurance (including dental)
3. Extracurricular activities
4. Post-secondary expenses

## Family Property
> Following a breakup, family property is generally divided equally.

Division of property after a divorce is a provincial matter. The BC *Family Law Act* governs how assets are divided. In BC, ***all family assets are divided equally***.  The spouse who owns ***non-family assets*** keeps them. 
Family assets are *assets acquired during the marriage for the benefit of the marriage*

### Exemptions from the Equal Division Rule
1. Length of Marriage - For very short marriages, it is unfair to make an equal division as one person may have brought many more assets into the marriage
2. Length of Separation - If separated for many years, it may be unreasonable to include assets acquired for each spouse's personal use during the period of separation
3. Date when asset acquired - if something is purchased just before the couple separates
4. Gifts and Inheritances - These are excluded unless the inheritance is used to purchase the family home or is otherwise ***co-mingled***: combined with other family assets.

## Spousal Support
The following factors influence spousal support decisions:
- Assets and financial status of each spouse including future earning potential;
- Ability of each spouse to be self-supporting;
- Ability of each spouse to provide support to the other spouse;
- Age and physical and mental health of each spouse;
- Length of time the couple was married and/or lived together;
- Length of time one spouse spent raising the family and not working;and
- Length of time it will take the one spouse to receive training or upgrade job skills.

## Matrimonial Home
> The home in which the spouses ordinarily reside during their marriage

1. If a couple splits their time evenly between two homes, both would be considered matrimonial homes
2. Neither spouse has the right to force out the other (both have the right to live in their matrimonial home)
3. On separation, the court might grant exclusivity to one spouse

# Family Law Part 5
### Who is entitled to Child Support
> Under provincial laws, parents must support any unmarried children living at home up to the age of majority

- 19 y/o: BC, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, NWT, Nova Scotia, Nunavut Yukon
- 18 y/o: AB, Manitoba, Ontario, PEI, Quebec and Saskatchewan

### Adoption
> In B.C., any person under the age of 19 and unmarried may be adopted. To adopt, the adoptive parent(s) must be 19 or older and may or may not be married.

#### How are children Placed?
1. Selection of the adoptive parents
	1. Involving a screening and the development of a "home study"
2. Placing the child in custody of the adoptive parents for a trial period of 6-12 months, while monitoring the progress of the child
3. Making an adoption order for permanent custody with the parents

#### Consent
In most cases, biological parents must consent to the adoption. If consent is not freely given, the consent is not binding. Many parents only allow adoptions after a set minimum period of time, usually 7-14 days after birth. 

A parent who has given consent may withdraw their consent for a limited period of time. In BC, this period is up to 30 days. 

All provinces and territories have enacted laws to protect children from neglect and abuse. In extreme cases, the courts may find that natural parents should no longer have the right to care for their children. In this situation, the Judge will issue a **Crown wardship order**, removing the children permanently from their parents' home. 

***If a child has been removed from a family through a Crown wardship order, permission for the adoption from the brith parents is not needed.***

#### Types of Adoptions
1. **Domestic Adoptions** are arranged through the provincial governments.
	1. Requires a home study
	2. Least expensive option
	3. Take more time
	4. Parents may have less chance of being able to select a child with the characteristics they desire.
	5. If the child is over 12, the child must consent to the adoption
2. **Private Adoptions** - arranged by an individual or an agency licensed by the government
	1. Usually a pregnant woman will seek out an adoption agency with the desire to be able to select the parents
	2. A home study is required
	3. The cost tends to be higher (for the adoptive parents, up to $10,000)
	4. More common than domestic adoptions
3. **International Adoptions** - adoptions from foreign countries
	1. Countries such as China, Russia, Guatemala and Romania are the leading source of international adoptions
	2. These tend to be faster and **more** expensive than the other forms of adoption.
