# Family Law Part 2
#### Prior Marriages
> It is illegal for a person to enter into a second marriage while still being married

This is known as **bigamy**, a form of **polygamy** and constitutes a *Criminal Offence* liable to up to five years in prison

If you have been previously married, you must present proof that the previous marriage had ended. In cases where people do marry a second time, while still married to their first spouse, ***the second marriage would be legally null and void***

#### Disappearance of a Spouse
In the event that a spouse disappears and cannot be found for a long period of time, an application can be made to the court for a "presumption of death" certificate.

If a presumed dead spouse is actually alive and returns after the surviving spouse has remarried, the second marriage would be declared void

#### Sexual Capacity
Traditionall, the ability to **consummate** the marriage was an essential requirement for marriage. If either party lacks sexual capacity, the marriage may be annulled. The inability to have sexual intercourse must result from a physical or psychological problem.

#### Changing Names
There is no legal obligation in Canada for women to adopt the surname of their spouse.

Options available
1. Retain maiden name
2. Adopt their spouse's suername
3. Hyphenate both names (Lee-Izawa)

When a child is born to a married couple, the child is usually given the husband's surname or the hyphenated name of both parents. *The child may receive the mother's surname if both parents consent*. In cases of dispute, the child receives both names in alphabetical order.

## Refining Marriage
In July of 2002, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that the definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman was an unjustifiable infringement of S.15 of the Charter.

## Termination of Marriage: Death, Annulment, Separation
### Separation
> An intermediate step between marriage and divorce. The spouses decide to live separately and apart from each other. Sometimes couples stop at this point and live the rest of their lives this way.

Usually, "separate and apart" implies that they live in separate locations and they do not intend to live together again

***A divorce becomes final 31 days after the judgement***

### Custody
The court looks at what is in the ***best interests of the child***
***Custody orders are never final***, meaning they can be revisited at any time by the court to ensure that any changing circumstances are addressed so that the best interests of the child are always considered

### Custody Tests
1. **Stability of Home Environment** - The courts seek to reduce stress through providing a steady and stable routine for the children. This often menas that if one spouse has traditionally taken care of the children (***The Primary Caregiver***), custody will be awarded to that spouse. Some factors include:
	1. Who attended the child's educational, cultural and religious development;
	2. Who took the child to medical appointments;
	3. Who prepared the child's meals;
	4. Who bought the child's clothing; and
	5. Who looked after the child after school
2. **Separation of Siblings** - Courts do not like to separate siblings. However, when they are separated, mothers usually get custody of girls and younger children, while fathers may get custody of boys or older children.
3. **Children's Preferences and Wishes** - The wishes of children aged 14 and older are taken very seriously. Generally, the older the child, the greater influence of their wishes on the courts decision
4. **Parental Conduct** - The court accounts for parental conduct *when it directly affects the child*. This conduct may include: drug or alcohol abuse, violence or rage, or anything that may put the child at harm.
5. **Religion** - Courts believe that both parents should have input and refrain from ridiculing the other parent's religion. The best interests of the child is foremost in the minds of the court
